# Sorting Algorithms Implementation and Performance Measurement

## Implemented Algorithms
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Insertion Sort
* In-Place Quick Sort
* Modified Quick Sort

## Features
* Generates a vector of length value given by user with random numbers.
* Calculates time taken by each sorting algorithm in ms.
* Can test sorted (ascending/descending) input vector performance by all algorithms.

## Instructions
* First generate executable using `/usr/bin/g++ -o main main.cpp`. This will generate `main` file which is executable.
* Run executable and pass vector_size (int) as argument which can be used to generate the vector of respectove length with random numbers as elements. Ex. `./main 10`
* To tests sorted (ascensind/descending) input vector, in main.js uncomment the respetive code section.
